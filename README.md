### Project Overview

#### What we tried to solve?

* We have tried to solve the problem of Centralized Authority Involved in conduction of Election.
---
### Solution Description

* Our approach to solve the problem of centralized system was to create a channel based blockchain, where every log of the user is added to the blockchain.
* Every Collection gets a snapshot creatd at reqular interval of time, which also has the has of hashes of privous snapshots.
* This chain helps to go back and check the malpractice with the data, as any single change in the block will change the hash value of block leading to breakage in the chain.
* This method helps us to remove a central power and just keep the moderator to the network.
* Every Block is uploaded to IPFS Network which can be checked at any time by anyone, but also maitaining the privacy and dignity of the system.
